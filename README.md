# vmwareproject2

Built a private cloud disaster recovery system to provision, deploy and decommission virtual machines in a Datacenter. It provides large scale statistics gathering and visualization of the collected data. Used the combination of Logstash, Elasticsearch and Kibana for the statistics collection and visualization. Also provided the facility to create alarms and receive email notifications for metrics when they reach the threshold.
